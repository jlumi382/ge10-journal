# WPE (Whole Person Education) Journal

This repository contains my **WPE Journal** for the **GE10** course. It showcases my activeness in the 5Cs (Classroom, Church, Cultural, Court, Community) through various sections that highlight my involvement in each category. The journal is a static website created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (without any frameworks) to learn about fundamental web development techniques, including **primitive development** and **Flexbox layout styling**.
