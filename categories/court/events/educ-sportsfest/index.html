                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>
                    I attended the College of Education Sportsfest by chance when I
                    heard the event from my boarding house. It piqued my curiosity so I
                    decided to check it out and was lucky to witness this exciting
                    sportsfest. I explored different games, including volleyball,
                    soccer, badminton, and basketball. Ultimately, I stayed to watch
                    three volleyball matches, as volleyball is my favorite sport. The
                    event brought back my enthusiasm and made me reflect on my recovery
                    journey from surgery.

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This event reminded me of how much I love volleyball and how
                        special it is to me compared to other sports. While I have been
                        playing table tennis during my recovery, it cannot compare to the
                        joy and energy volleyball brings me. Watching the matches
                        reignited my passion for the game and motivated me to focus on my
                        recovery so I can play volleyball again without any physical
                        limitations. It was an uplifting experience that reminded me of
                        the importance of doing what you love.

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now, I am more determined than ever to continue my recovery and
                        get back to playing volleyball. This event also taught me to
                        appreciate opportunities like this, even when they come
                        unexpectedly. Moving forward, I plan to actively look for ways to
                        stay connected with the sport and maintain my enthusiasm for it,
                        whether through watching games, practicing, or playing when I am
                        fully healed.

                    <p>
                        Because of this activity, I am more inspired to recover fully and
                        return to playing volleyball with all my heart. It reminded me of
                        how deeply I value the sport and how much joy it brings to my
                        life. This experience also encouraged me to stay open to
                        unexpected opportunities and to cherish the moments that reignite
                        my passions.
