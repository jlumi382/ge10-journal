<h3>What?</h3>
<p>On October 20, 2024, I attended the Blacklist Cup 2024 at the
Daro RUSI Field. Although I didn't know much about frisbee
beforehand, this event was a great opportunity for me to learn more
about the game. Watching the teams play helped me understand the
basic rules, such as how players pass the frisbee to each other,
the importance of positioning, and the concept of scoring points by
catching the frisbee in the opposing team’s end zone.</p>

<div class="section flex-item p2-p3">

<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>The event made me realize how physically demanding frisbee is.
It’s not just about skill, but also endurance. The game is played
on a large field, and players are constantly running, pivoting, and
changing direction. Watching the players maintain such high energy
throughout the game gave me a new appreciation for the physical
stamina required to play. This experience also made me think about
how sports can teach us discipline, teamwork, and resilience.</p>
</div>
<div class="p3">
<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>From attending the Blacklist Cup 2024, I learned the importance
of pushing through physical exhaustion, especially when faced with
long stretches of intense activity. Even though frisbee was new to
me, I was able to connect with the game by observing how players
worked together to move the frisbee down the field. It motivated me
to improve my own physical endurance and learn more about the
sport. It also reminded me how trying something new can be both
challenging and rewarding.</p>

<h3>How This Changed Me</h3>
<div class="flex-item contents"><img src=
"../../../../data/events/blacklist-cup/proof.jpg" alt="Proof">
<p>Because of this activity, I am more open to exploring new sports
and activities. I now appreciate frisbee and how it can challenge
both the body and the mind. This experience has also sparked an
interest in trying frisbee myself, further expanding my
appreciation for team sports and fitness.</p>
