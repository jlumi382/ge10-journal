                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On August 22, 2024, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, I participated in
                    the semi-finals of the Esports Leaderboards held at ATA Hall. The
                    main objective of the event was to showcase the Mobile Legends
                    gaming skills of Sillimanians and determine which team was the
                    strongest. As a member of the working technical committee, I helped
                    in setting up the livestream.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section flex-item p2-p3">
                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>Before the event, I expected we would use OBS Studio to
                        broadcast the game live, which turned out to be correct. However, I
                        wasn’t able to contribute much because my phone wasn’t compatible
                        with the laptop used for the livestream. However, I learned about a
                        new tool named scrcpy, a phone mirroring software for Android
                        devices. It allowed them to project the phone’s screen to the
                        laptop via a USB connection. Once everything was set up, we had a
                        great time watching the game, especially with the energetic
                        shoutcasters. Helping out didn’t feel like work at all! The
                        atmosphere was fun and relaxed, which made it an enjoyable way to
                        unwind after a long day at ROTC. It was nice to see how Silliman
                        knew how to blend fun with work.</p>

                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This experience also taught me the benefits of projecting a
                        phone screen using a wired USB connection. I had previously
                        mirrored my phone screen through WiFi, but this affected my
                        stream’s upload speed and projection quality, as the FPS relied
                        heavily on internet speed. While using WiFi offers the advantage of
                        a free charging port, projecting through a USB connection is more
                        stable. However, using the USB port for both projection and
                        charging can limit the charging speed. If I had the chance to do
                        this event again, I would hope my phone would be compatible with
                        the streaming setup, as I would have loved to manage the game
                        camera myself.</p>

                        alt="Proof">
                    <p>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the technical
                        aspects involved in live streaming and mobile device projection. I
                        learned how to use software like scrcpy to mirror Android screens
                        to a PC, which I previously struggled with using WiFi. This new
                        knowledge will be helpful for future events where stable streaming
                        is essential. Overall, I gained valuable insights into both the
                        technology and the importance of working together in event
                        management.</p>
