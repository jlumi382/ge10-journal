                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On August 24, 2024, I attended the Esports Leaderboards Finals
                    as a spectator, where I witnessed an intense Mobile Legends match
                    between Samantutay Esports and Mad All Stars. The competition
                    showcased the skill, teamwork, and strategies that make esports
                    such a thrilling experience. As someone who plays Mobile Legends, I
                    found the gameplay exciting, particularly the first match, which
                    was full of surprises and unexpected shifts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section flex-item p2-p3">
                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>The match was a reminder of how quickly things can change in
                        competitive games. Samantutay Esports initially held a dominating
                        lead, and it seemed like they were on their way to an easy victory.
                        However, a critical mistake during their final push turned the game
                        around, giving Mad All Stars the chance to counterattack and
                        dominate the rest of the match. This moment emphasized the
                        importance of staying composed and focused, even when victory feels
                        within reach. Mad All Stars’ ability to capitalize on their
                        opponent’s error and maintain their momentum was a testament to
                        their teamwork and resilience. Their win was well-deserved and
                        highlighted the value of perseverance in esports.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>As a Mobile Legends player, watching this match inspired me to
                        reflect on my own gameplay. It showed me the importance of strategy
                        and decision-making, especially during high-pressure moments. The
                        game also demonstrated how mistakes are an inevitable part of
                        competition, but they can also create opportunities for others.
                        This perspective encourages me to stay adaptable and learn from
                        setbacks, whether in games or other aspects of life. Additionally,
                        the energy of the audience and the competitive spirit of the teams
                        made me appreciate how esports can bring people together and foster
                        a sense of community.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am reminded of the unpredictability
                        of competition and the importance of staying focused until the very
                        end. Watching Mad All Stars secure their victory through skill and
                        determination was inspiring.</p>
