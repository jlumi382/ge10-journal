                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>During Pasiklaban Day 1, I watched the second game of men's
                    basketball between the Green Pythons and the Red Phantoms. As
                    someone who used to play basketball as a kid, I didn’t enjoy the
                    sport as much as volleyball, and I stopped pursuing it. Watching
                    this game, however, was a completely different experience. The
                    skill and technique displayed by the players were incredible, and
                    their level of play was truly impressive. The Green Pythons won,
                    and it was a well-deserved victory.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>Seeing the game made me realize how little I know about the
                        technical side of basketball and how much strategy is involved. It
                        changed my perspective and gave me a newfound respect for the
                        sport. It’s not just about scoring or running up and down the
                        court—it requires precision, teamwork, and quick decision-making.
                        The way the players communicated and executed their plays was
                        inspiring.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>After this event, I’m motivated to look into basketball
                        techniques and strategies, even if just to appreciate it better as
                        a spectator. While volleyball will always be my preferred sport,
                        this experience taught me to respect all sports for the dedication
                        and skill they require. It also encouraged me to be open to
                        learning more about activities outside of my comfort zone.</p>

                <h3>How This Changed Me</h3>
                <div class="flex-item contents"><img src="../../../../data/events/pasiklaban-d1/proof.jpg" alt="Proof">
                    <p>Because of this activity, I am more appreciative of sports I
                        don’t actively play. Watching this basketball game has helped me
                        develop respect for the skills and hard work required to excel in
                        sports I don’t fully understand. It also reminded me to always stay
                        open-minded and value the diversity of talents people bring to
                        different areas.</p>
