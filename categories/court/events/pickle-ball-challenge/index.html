          <h3>What?</h3>
          <p>
            I attended the All-Dumaguete Pickleball Challenge, though I arrived
            late due to having the wrong schedule. Despite this, I was fortunate
            to catch the final doubles game. It was a mixed match featuring two
            young men, a middle-aged woman, and an adult woman. Their skills and
            teamwork were inspiring to watch, highlighting the accessibility and
            inclusivity of pickleball as a sport.

          <div class="p2">
            <h3>So What?</h3>
            <p>
              Watching the game helped me appreciate how pickleball brings
              people of different ages and backgrounds together. It emphasized
              that sports are not only about competition but also about building
              connections and fostering inclusivity. Seeing players with such
              varied experiences perform well gave me a new perspective on
              teamwork and resilience.

            <h3>Now What?</h3>
            <p>
              After witnessing this event, I am eager to try pickleball in our
              PE classes. It seems like a fun and engaging sport that combines
              skill and strategy. I plan to explore it more actively and
              potentially encourage others to give it a try. This experience has
              also reinforced my belief in trying new activities to expand my
              skills and interests.

          <h3>How This Changed Me</h3>

            <img
              src="../../../../data/events/pickle-ball-challenge/proof.jpg"

            />
            <p>
              Because of this activity, I am more open to exploring sports
              outside of my comfort zone. The inclusivity and skill displayed in
              the game I watched inspired me to embrace new opportunities and
              challenges, whether in sports or other areas of my life. I look
              forward to trying pickleball and growing from the experience.
