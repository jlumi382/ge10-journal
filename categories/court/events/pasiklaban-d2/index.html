                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On the second day of Pasiklaban, I watched the fifth men's
                    volleyball game between the Green Pythons and the Blue Dragons.
                    Volleyball is my favorite sport, so I could deeply understand and
                    appreciate the plays made by both teams. The match was incredibly
                    close and intense, which was evident in the screaming and cheering
                    of the audience. In the end, the Blue Dragons emerged victorious
                    after an exciting and hard-fought game.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>This game reminded me how much I love volleyball and how deeply
                        I connect with the sport. Watching such an intense match made me
                        admire the players’ endurance, teamwork, and strategic thinking. It
                        also stirred a strong desire within me to recover fully from my
                        varicocele surgery so I can jump and play volleyball without any
                        physical constraints. This experience not only entertained me but
                        also reignited my passion for the game.</p>

                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>Moving forward, I am determined to focus on my recovery and
                        physical well-being so I can play volleyball again. This event has
                        also inspired me to study game strategies more seriously, as I
                        realized the importance of not just playing but also understanding
                        the nuances of the sport. I aim to apply these lessons when I get
                        back on the court and to cherish every moment I spend playing
                        volleyball.</p>

                <h3>How This Changed Me</h3>
                <div class="flex-item contents"><img src="../../../../data/events/pasiklaban-d2/proof.jpg" alt="Proof">
                    <p>Because of this activity, I am more motivated to recover fully
                        and regain my ability to play volleyball without limitations. This
                        game has strengthened my passion for volleyball and reminded me of
                        the joy and inspiration the sport brings to my life. It has also
                        taught me to value my health and to work towards making a strong
                        comeback.</p>
