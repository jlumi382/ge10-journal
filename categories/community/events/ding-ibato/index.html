<h3>What?</h3>
<p>I was a co-organizer and the head of logistics for the Ding
Ibato event, a dodgeball tournament aimed at raising funds for the
Dumaguete Animal Sanctuary. Our efforts resulted in sufficient
donations to provide supplies such as dog food and anti-fungal
shampoo. As the head of logistics, my responsibilities included
preparing materials like medals and certificates and securing the
permit for the Ravello Field venue. This role gave me a deeper
understanding of event organization and logistics.</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>This experience taught me the value of teamwork and
collaboration in achieving a common goal. Each committee member
contributed their skills, and it was rewarding to see the event run
smoothly and make a tangible impact for the Dumaguete Animal
Sanctuary. On a personal level, I felt connected to the players
since part of my duties involved retrieving dodgeballs that went
out of bounds. The combination of responsibility and involvement
made the event exciting and fulfilling for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="p3">
<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>Moving forward, I plan to use the organizational skills I
developed from this event in future activities. I have a clearer
understanding of the importance of thorough preparation and
effective teamwork, which I can apply to other areas in my life.
Additionally, this experience inspired me to participate in more
events with charitable goals, as they provide both personal growth
and opportunities to contribute meaningfully to the community.</p>

<h3>How This Changed Me</h3>
<div class="flex-item contents"><img src=
"../../../../data/events/ding-ibato/proof.jpg" alt="Proof">
<p>Because of this activity, I am more confident in my ability to
lead and collaborate in a team. I gained a greater appreciation for
the hard work that goes into organizing events and the impact they
can have on others. This experience also reminded me of the joy in
contributing to a cause bigger than myself, motivating me to stay
engaged in community service projects.</p>
