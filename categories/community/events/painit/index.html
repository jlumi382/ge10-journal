                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On September 16, 2024, I took part in an event called
                    PaInit-Paghatag ug kaInit, organized by the DOST Scholar's
                    Association at Silliman University. This event was held in response
                    to the ongoing challenges caused by Typhoon Enteng, aiming to
                    provide snacks and coffee to the university personnel who were
                    tirelessly working on campus despite the difficult weather. The
                    event started with a Google Meeting orientation at 9:00 AM,
                    followed by the distribution of snacks at 2:30 PM. My role was a
                    lead organizer, along with my fellow DOST scholars from the College
                    of Computer Studies.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>At first, I was nervous about fulfilling my responsibilities,
                        especially since I am still a bit shy around my fellow DOST
                        scholars from CCS. However, everyone was very friendly, and I
                        gradually became more comfortable. The experience helped me improve
                        my socializing skills, and seeing the smiles of the university
                        personnel despite the bad weather made the effort even more
                        rewarding. It was heartwarming to offer them some comfort in a
                        difficult time. This was also my first experience as an organizer
                        in a community event, and it taught me a lot about how to plan and
                        execute such activities. Overall, this event helped me grow in my
                        ability to share warmth and care with others.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>Participating in this event shifted my perspective on community
                        work. I used to think that my efforts alone wouldn’t make a
                        significant impact, but this experience showed me the power of
                        teamwork. Working alongside others who share the same motivations
                        allowed us to accomplish much more than we ever could alone. This
                        realization encouraged me to continue organizing community events
                        with my fellow DOST scholars, as I now understand how important it
                        is to collaborate to achieve common goals. Additionally, it
                        strengthened my connections with the other DOST scholars from CCS
                        and deepened my appreciation for the value of community-driven
                        initiatives.</p>

                <h3>How This Changed Me</h3>
                <div class="flex-item contents"><img src="../../../../data/events/painit/proof.jpg" alt="Proof">
                    <p>Because of this activity, I have gained confidence in my ability
                        to take part in and lead future community events. It made me more
                        aware of the power of small acts of kindness, and I am now more
                        determined to continue contributing to efforts that help others,
                        especially in times of need. This event has motivated me to stay
                        active in organizing and participating in activities that
                        strengthen the bonds within our community and help those who need
                        support.</p>
