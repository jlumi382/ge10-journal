                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>
                    On September 29, 2024, at 5:30 AM, I participated in a coastal
                    cleanup at Silliman Beach organized by the DOST Scholar's
                    Association. This event aimed to contribute to a cleaner environment
                    and to promote the importance of community work. As a participant, I
                    joined other volunteers in removing litter and debris from the
                    coast, fulfilling the purpose of the event.

            <div class="section flex-item p2-p3">
                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I expected the coast to have more trash, but to my surprise, it
                        wasn’t as bad as I thought. During the cleanup, I came across a
                        glass bottle near a neighborhood area, and an elderly lady thanked
                        me for taking it away. This small interaction was deeply
                        satisfying and reminded me why I enjoy participating in these
                        events. Moments like this motivate me to stay engaged in community
                        service.

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The experience has further strengthened my desire to support the
                        community. As a DOST Scholar, where our organization frequently
                        engages in community initiatives, I am committed to participating
                        and encouraging others to join us. This event not only helped the
                        residents but also made a positive impact on the food stalls in
                        the area by providing a cleaner environment.

                    <p>
                        Because of this activity, I am more inspired to continue
                        contributing to community events. The joy of helping out and
                        seeing the immediate effects of our efforts makes me want to be
                        more involved in similar activities in the future. This event has
                        reaffirmed my commitment to being an active member of the
                        community and promoting environmental awareness.
