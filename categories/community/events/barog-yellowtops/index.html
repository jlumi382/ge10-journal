                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On September 17, 2024, I participated in the Barog Yellowtops donation drive, organized by Ang Sandigan. The purpose of this event was to provide support to six families impacted by the fire that occurred on September 9th in Purok Yellowtops Zone 3, Barangay Candau-ay. Donations were collected until 12:00 PM at two locations, which were the Oriental Hall and near the Confederates Student Council Office for the College of Computer Studies (CCS). My role was to contribute as a participant in this effort.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>The day before this, I took part in a different community event that aimed to assist Silliman University personnel who continued to work despite the suspension of classes due to bad weather. We distributed snacks to show appreciation for their dedication. Inspired by this act of service, I was eager to participate in Barog Yellowtops when I heard about it. The task was simple because you only had to donate and help, but it meant a lot to me as it was another opportunity to extend a hand to those in need.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This event made me realize the value of small acts of kindness. When done collectively by those who are able, these small efforts grow into something significant. I believe this initiative will greatly assist the six families who were victims of the Purok Yellowtops fire, and I feel empowered to continue contributing to similar efforts whenever I can.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am reminded that no contribution is too small when it comes to helping others. It has made me more mindful of the importance of community and generosity, and I am now more committed than ever to participating in initiatives that uplift others, especially those in need.</p>
