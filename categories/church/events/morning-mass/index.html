                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On September 22, 2024, I attended the 6:00 AM Sunday Mass at St. Vincent Ferrer Parish Church in Larena, Siquijor. This weekly Roman Catholic service was organized by the parish, and I participated as a spectator. It was a meaningful occasion for me, as I had just returned to Siquijor and was eager to attend church with my mother. The familiar environment and the chance to reconnect with my faith made this event special.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>I had been anticipating this day, as I was dealing with an existential crisis, feeling inadequate compared to my classmates. The priest's message addressed this very feeling, helping me reflect on my struggles. He shared a humorous, fictional story about a duck and a dog, who attempted to attend a disco party by flying together, with the dog relying on the duck. When asked whose idea it was, the dog proudly claimed it, only to be dropped and later cooked. This amusing tale illustrated a lesson that true greatness is not about reaching the top by stepping on others but by lifting each other up, a lesson rooted in Christâ€™s teachings of shared success.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This mass helped me realize that while I may not be the best at everything, nor the best at what I do well, I can still achieve greatness by helping others rise alongside me. This acceptance brought me a sense of peace. The next time I return to Siquijor, I will definitely attend the mass again, as it provided clarity to my thoughts and offered in my journey.</p>

                <h3>How This Changed Me</h3>
                <div class="flex-item contents">
                    <p>Because of this activity, I am reminded that life is not about competing to be at the top but about elevating others as we grow. This experience has inspired me to embrace collaboration and humility as the true measures of success. I will continue to apply this lesson in my daily life, knowing that helping others is a path to true greatness.</p>
