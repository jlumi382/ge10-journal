                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>
                    On September 22, 2024, I attended the 6:00 AM Sunday Mass at St.
                    Vincent Ferrer Parish Church in Larena, Siquijor. This weekly Roman
                    Catholic service was organized by the parish, and I participated as
                    a spectator. It was a meaningful occasion for me, as I had just
                    returned to Siquijor and was eager to attend church with my mother.
                    The familiar environment and the chance to reconnect with my faith
                    made this event special.

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I had been anticipating this day, as I was dealing with an
                        existential crisis, feeling inadequate compared to my classmates.
                        The priest's message addressed this very feeling, helping me
                        reflect on my struggles. He shared a humorous, fictional story
                        about a duck and a dog, who attempted to attend a disco party by
                        flying together, with the dog relying on the duck. When asked
                        whose idea it was, the dog proudly claimed it, only to be dropped
                        and later cooked. This amusing tale illustrated a lesson that true
                        greatness is not about reaching the top by stepping on others but
                        by lifting each other up, a lesson rooted in Christ’s teachings of
                        shared success.

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This mass helped me realize that while I may not be the best at
                        everything, nor the best at what I do well, I can still achieve
                        greatness by helping others rise alongside me. This acceptance
                        brought me a sense of peace. The next time I return to Siquijor, I
                        will definitely attend the mass again, as it provided clarity to
                        my thoughts and offered in my journey.

                    <p>
                        Because of this activity, I am reminded that life is not about
                        competing to be at the top but about elevating others as we grow.
                        This experience has inspired me to embrace collaboration and
                        humility as the true measures of success. I will continue to apply
                        this lesson in my daily life, knowing that helping others is a
                        path to true greatness.
