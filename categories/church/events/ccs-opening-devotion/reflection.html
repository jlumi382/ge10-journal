            <p>On August 19, 2024, from 7:30 AM to 9:00 AM, I attended the **CCS Opening Devotion** at Silliman University Church as a participant, where I joined my fellow College of Computer Studies students in a meaningful gathering. The objective of the event was to deepen our spiritual connection and to remind us of the importance faith in our daily lives as students.</p>
            <p>When I first arrived, I didn't know how the event would go or what kind of impact it would have on me. However, my expectations changed as I listened to Rev. Iris H. Tibus, whose words left a lasting impression. She explained the meaning of CCS, emphasizing that it stands for **C**ommitting all plans and activities to God, **C**onnecting with God in prayer, and **S**urrendering all glory and credit to God. This stuck with me, as it aligns with my own values and the way I approach challenges in life. The most impactful part of the event was hearing this message, which reinforced my belief that with God by my side, I can face any obstacle with courage and determination.</p> 
            <p>This experience has changed my perspective on challenges, making me see them as obstacles that I will inevitably overcome because I know that God is always with me. It has also inspired me to uphold these values and share them with my peers, especially those who may be struggling or feeling lost. The event served as a reminder that even during the busy Hibalag Week, Sillimanians remain devoted to their faith, never forgetting to make time for God.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I am better better than who I was yesterday, I now have a greater sense of self-trust and confidence, knowing that God is always supporting me.</p>
