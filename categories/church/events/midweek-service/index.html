                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On October 23, 2024, at 6:30 PM, I attended the Midweek Service
                    at the Silliman University Church, an event organized by the
                    Department of Science and Technology Scholars' Association in
                    Silliman University. The objective of the service was to bring
                    students together for a time of reflection and worship. My role in
                    this event was as an usher, where I was tasked with welcoming
                    attendees, guiding them to their seats, and ensuring that the
                    service ran smoothly. Although I was nervous about participating in
                    this role, especially since it was my first time and I’m not very
                    active in religious activities, it ended up being a fulfilling
                    experience. The other ushers and members of the church staff were
                    very supportive, and their guidance helped me feel more at
                    ease.</p>

                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>Through this experience, I enhanced my public interaction
                        skills. Before this event, I was anxious about stepping out of my
                        comfort zone, especially since I don’t usually participate in
                        religious activities. My initial expectations were to simply
                        observe and maybe help a bit, but It was quite easy so I was able
                        to do more than what I expected. Even though I was nervous at
                        first, I found that my nervousness faded as the service went on,
                        and I started to feel more confident in my duties. One of the
                        people who left a strong impression on me was a fellow DOST
                        Scholar, who was calm and kind, providing helpful guidance whenever
                        I felt unsure. I appreciated how their experience helped me manage
                        my own nerves. The most satisfying part of the activity was
                        realizing that I could step up and be a part of something larger,
                        despite not being active in religious settings.</p>

                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This experience has broadened my worldview by showing me that
                        there are many ways to contribute to a community, even if it’s
                        outside of my usual interests. I learned that stepping outside my
                        comfort zone can lead to personal growth and help me develop new
                        skills. Moving forward, I can apply this learning by being more
                        open to participating in these types of activities, even if they
                        are unfamiliar or make me feel nervous. I also plan to stay
                        involved with the activities that the Department of Science and
                        Technology Scholars' Association will come up with, as I realize
                        how valuable it is to be part of a supportive group. This activity
                        taught me the importance of being open to new experiences. If I
                        could do the project again, I would try to interact more with the
                        attendees, as I found that engaging with people is an essential
                        part of the usher role.</p>
