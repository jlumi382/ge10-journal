                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On September 4, 2024, at 6:30 PM, I attended a PSALM Fellowship session held at Freedom Park. The objective of the session was to enlighten voluntary participants about the true meaning of forgiveness and how it is demonstrated through Christ. My role in the activity was simply as a participant.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>I attended my first social event for believers of God and worried about not knowing much about the Bible. During a game, I struggled to name a Bible character, but the people were kind and supportive. I made new friends, Carl and Jas, who welcomed me warmly. The speaker shared the story of Joseph, who was favored but faced many hardships due to his arrogance. After being sold into slavery and falsely imprisoned, he eventually interpreted dreams and rose to become Pharaoh's second-in-command. Joseph’s journey taught me that hardships often have a purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>Attending this event was a truly eye-opening experience, and I intend to carry its teachings with me throughout my life. If time allows, I would gladly join this event again. Joseph’s ability to look past his betrayals and forgive those who wronged him is an incredibly difficult thing to do, but it is something I aspire to work on in my own life.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the importance of forgiveness and how it can shape my personal growth and relationships with others. It taught me that holding onto resentment only hinders progress, while learning to forgive like Joseph did can lead to peace and reconciliation. I also feel more connected to the community of believers and encouraged to continue learning about faith. The kindness and support I experienced made me realize that it's okay not to know everything, as growth happens through participation and shared experiences.</p>
