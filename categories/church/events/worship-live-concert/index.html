                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>The Worship Live Concert took place on August 31, 2024, from 6 PM to 8 PM at Silliman University Church. As a participant and spectator, I joined in the event, which aimed to worship and praise God in a shared and uplifting atmosphere.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>At first, I was confused why the speaker told us to get mad. He told us to get mad for Jesus. And I meant it literally, so I was very puzzled. He then talked about being like Peter and John, who were very faithful to God. This speech emphasized the importance of not going to God to receive something from him but to receive the giver of gifts. He advised everyone to make a difference by manifesting our faith in Jesus. And to prove this faith, we should assist others. By the end of the speech, I was so surprised because what he meant by MAD was <b>M</b>anifest your gift of faith, <b>A</b>ssist other's burdens, and <b>Draw</b> others to God. It was such a beautifully structured message, and this acronym of MAD is very memorable. We also had a great time worshiping God with songs like Praise Medley, Heart of Worship, Pupurihin ka sa Awit, Refiner, and many more.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>Attending this event has changed my perspective on prayers. It is not simply about asking something from God and receiving what you asked for. It was about receiving the giver of gifts, God himself. I will instill these values throughout my journey in life. Doing this activity will definitely make you a better person and a greater servant of God. If I were to do this event, again, I wish I would've been able to arrive earlier and experience more worshiping songs.</p>
