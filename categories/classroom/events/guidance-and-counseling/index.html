                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>
                    On August 19, 2024, I attended a Guidance and Counseling Group
                    Dynamics activity from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM as a participant at the
                    ATA Hall, which aimed to form bonds with my fellow College of
                    Computer Studies (CCS) freshmen.

            <div class="section flex-item p2-p3">
                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a participant and spectator, I went in with no clear
                        expectations since it was my first time hearing about such an
                        event, and we were required to attend. From the title, I initially
                        thought we might be working on some sort of programming project as
                        a group. However, the activity turned out to be something far more
                        essential and meaningful. The event's focus on getting to know my
                        fellow CCS freshmen was something I found particularly valuable,
                        as I often struggle to initiate conversations with others. The
                        games we played, like the one where we evolved from an egg to a
                        supreme being by winning rock-paper-scissors, carried deeper
                        meanings than they initially appeared. This game, for instance,
                        taught us the importance of perseverance in striving to become the
                        best version of ourselves. I also enjoyed the dragon game, where
                        we had to catch the other team's tail. The strategy and teamwork
                        involved in that game helped me form strong connections with my
                        teammates, and it was incredibly satisfying to see our plans come
                        to life.

                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through these activities, I realized how teamwork and strategizing
                        skills which was something that I lacked are vital in any group
                        activity. The experience made me reflect on my tendency to tackle
                        challenges alone, and I now see that there are limits to what I
                        can achieve by myself. This event emphasized the importance of
                        trust and cooperation within a team, and it has encouraged me to
                        be more cooperative in future group situations. I can definitely
                        see the benefits of this activity, as it fosters bonds and
                        friendships among CCS freshmen who may not have known each other
                        before. If I could participate again, I would strive to connect
                        with even more of my fellow CCS freshmen.

                    <p>
                        Because of this activity I am a better team player. I've also
                        become less shy when talking to people.
