                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On September 11, 2024, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, I attended the
                    University-Wide Orientation at the Luce Auditorium as a spectator.
                    The objective of the event was to familiarize freshmen with the
                    various services, facilities, and laws that Silliman University
                    provides to ensure an efficient and safe learning environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section flex-item p2-p3">
                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>Initially, I thought the orientation would be a simple and quick
                        overview of what we need to do to succeed in college, but I was
                        completely wrong. We were given handouts for the flow of the event,
                        and it had so much in store for us freshmen. One of the most
                        significant parts for me was learning about the Office of Student
                        Services, which I had no idea existed before. I also appreciated
                        the university's commitment to safety by informing us about
                        anti-sexual harassment, safe spaces, anti-hazing, bullying, and
                        drug testing policies. Additionally, the student government offers
                        various organizations and events, which could interest many
                        students, and there are essential services like medical assistance
                        and the university library. The Tula-Dula performance was also a
                        very fun and creative way to explain the university services. While
                        there was a lot of information for me to take in, I believe this
                        information will be very useful for us freshmen.</p>

                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>Attending the orientation made me realize that Silliman
                        University provides a wide array of resources for students to
                        ensure a smooth academic journey. From academic advising to mental
                        health support, the various services available are designed to
                        assist students in navigating both their studies and personal
                        challenges. The information I gained was invaluable and will
                        definitely help me know where to turn when I face challenges that I
                        cannot handle on my own. I appreciated the opportunity to meet
                        faculty members and fellow students who shared their own
                        experiences, further reinforcing the sense of community that
                        Silliman fosters. Overall, attending the event was far from a waste
                        of time; it was a pivotal moment that equipped me with the
                        knowledge and confidence to make the most of my university
                        experience.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am now more confident that I can
                        navigate my time at Silliman University effectively, knowing that
                        the school provides support in so many areas. The services and
                        resources presented have reassured me that I will have the help I
                        need whenever I face difficulties, whether academic or
