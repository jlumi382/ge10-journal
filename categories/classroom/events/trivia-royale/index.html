                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>
                    On August 21, 2024, from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, I participated in the
                    Trivia Royale event at ATA Hall. The objective of the session was to
                    learn more about the tech industry and the College of Computer
                    Science (CCS) at Silliman University. I was part of the working
                    committee, specifically contributing to the Technicals Committee for
                    this event.

                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was initially very nervous since it was my first time working in
                        this role. The night before, I kept overthinking how challenging
                        my tasks might be. However, it turned out to be a simple job, as
                        we were mainly sitting on the side operating the Kahoot quiz game.
                        I also got the chance to bond with JAD, another Committee member
                        assigned to the same event. The experience was both fun and
                        enlightening, with players using unique and funny names in the
                        game. The trivia covered interesting facts about the tech industry
                        and our college, and I learned things I didn’t know before.
                    </p>

                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This event made me realize the importance of familiarizing
                        yourself with your environment and the path you are pursuing. By
                        participating, I got to learn about the inside jokes in CCS,
                        discover cool trivia about the school, and gain insight into the
                        tech industry. Next time, I would love to join the event as a
                        player.

                <h3>How This Changed Me</h3>

                    <p>
                        Because of this activity, I am more confident in my ability to
                        contribute to future events. Initially, I was anxious about my
                        role in the Technicals Committee, but the experience taught me
                        that sometimes things are simpler than they seem. I also realized
                        how much I enjoy being part of a team, collaborating with others,
                        and learning new things along the way. This event gave me a
                        greater appreciation for both the tech industry and the college,
                        and I look forward to taking on more roles in similar activities
                        with newfound confidence.
