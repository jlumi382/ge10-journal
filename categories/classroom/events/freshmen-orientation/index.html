                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On September 18, 2024, I attended the Freshmen Orientation for
                    the College of Computer Studies (CCS), which began at 8:30 AM. As a
                    member of the working committee, I was responsible for managing the
                    technical aspects of the event, such as setting up the projector,
                    audio, and operating the presentation. The purpose of the
                    orientation was to familiarize the CCS freshmen with the college’s
                    grading system, awards, facilities, and other services.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section flex-item p2-p3">
                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>I was somewhat nervous because I wasn’t sure how to set up the
                        audio system, projector, and other equipment at the ATA Hall.
                        Fortunately, I was assigned to work with two other members of the
                        Technicals Committee, who also happened to be my friends. I watched
                        JP set up the projector and microphone, and now I feel more
                        confident about handling these tasks in the future. Additionally, I
                        wasn’t very familiar with the grading system or the criteria for
                        awards, but now that I’ve learned about them, I know what to
                        expect. This event gave me a lot of new information that will be
                        helpful throughout my journey here at Silliman University.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This experience expanded my knowledge about our college
                        department. Now, if I ever need to shift programs, get an absence
                        excused, or visit the library, I know exactly where to go. As a
                        freshman, the orientation was really helpful because it made me
                        feel less lost within the school. I hope that over time, I will
                        become even more familiar with the different areas of the
                        department, which will make my time here more comfortable and
                        efficient.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am now more confident in navigating
                        both the academic and administrative aspects of my college life. I
                        feel better prepared to face future challenges, whether it’s
                        handling technical tasks during events or understanding the
                        policies and services offered by the college. This orientation has
                        been an essential step in making me feel more at home in the
                        College of Computer Studies.</p>
