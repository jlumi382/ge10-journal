                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On August 21, 2024, I attended the Book Bingo event, which was scheduled from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The session aimed to provide life advice from a guest speaker and explore fictional characters from books and mangas. My role in this activity was primarily as a participant and spectator, eager to gain insights and enjoy the event.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>Initially, I expected the event to be purely fun, given its playful name, Book Bingo. However, it began with an inspiring talk from the guest speaker, who emphasized the formula <q class="peach-txt"><b><i>curiosity x desire for change = innovation.</i></b></q> He shared a story about his friend who founded a successful startup that helps students find internships. Instead of following the conventional path of applying for internships like his classmates, his friend chose to create a platform to solve a problem he identified. This story ignited a burning passion to pursue my dreams within me, highlighting the importance of taking initiative when faced with challenges. After the talk, we engaged in mini-games, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Except for the final one involving dancing, I'm very bad at it.</p>

                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This experience shifted my perspective on life and my future. I realized the importance of pursuing my own interests rather than simply following the majority. The speaker's story reinforced the idea that it is crucial to carve out your own path and find your purpose, rather than blindly adhering to what others are doing. This event was both enlightening and enjoyable, though I must admit that the extended duration past lunchtime was a bit taxing.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am more confident in my ability to determine what I want in life. I am no longer afraid to take a different path from my peers if it means achieving my dreams. This event has empowered me to continue seeking and pursuing the things that truly matter to me.</p>
