                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On August 20, 2024, I attended the <q class="peach-txt"><b><i>Balik Talent Lecture: Big Data and IoT:
                                Why They
                                Matter in Innovation</i></b></q>, held at ATA Hall from 8:30 AM to
                    11:30 AM. My role in the event was a spectator or participant, who
                    listened to the alumni's lecture.</p>

            <div class="section flex-item p2-p3">
                <div class="p2">
                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>Before the lecture, I only new the meaning of the acronym of
                        IoT, knowing it stood for the Internet of Things, but the concept
                        remained unfamiliar to me, especially when paired with Big Data.
                        However, as the speaker began providing examples, my understanding
                        and appreciation for these topics grew. One example mentioned smart
                        buildings in Singapore, where automated lights would turn on when
                        sensors detected darkness and off when it was bright. Another
                        example was the use of sensors in Formula 1 cars, which track the
                        car's and driver's health, generating vast amounts of data which is
                        essentially Big Data. This data can be used to control various
                        components automatically and remotely through IoT. This aligned
                        closely with my interest in machine learning.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This lecture opened my eyes to the possibilities of IoT and Big
                        Data, inspiring me to consider these concepts in future projects.
                        With this new knowledge, I can now create abstract pseudocode or
                        flowcharts to plan projects and learn the necessary programming
                        languages to bring my ideas to life. I am grateful for this event,
                        not only as an opportunity for alumni to give back to their alma
                        mater but also as a valuable learning experience for students like
                        me in the College of Computer Studies, who needs to know about the
                        vast fields of the tech industry.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am now able to understand the basic
                        concepts of Big Data and IoT. If I achieve success in the future, I
                        hope to give back to my school in a similar way, contributing to
                        the education and inspiration of the next generation of
                        students.</p>
