                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>The Parada Sillimaniana took place on August 26, 2024, starting at 1:00 PM. The event was part of the Hibalag Week festivities, welcoming both current Silliman students and alumni. The parade made its way through the streets, eventually reaching the Cimafranca Ballfield. I participated as both a spectator and a participant in certain moments.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>Before the event, I learned that only those with the CCS polo could march in the parade. Since I didn’t have one, I planned to wait at the ballfield until 1:00 PM. However, I was later asked to join the parade. Due to my recent varicocelectomy surgery, I chose to prioritize my safety and didn't march. Instead, I assisted a friend on the attendance committee. Watching the event was enjoyable, especially the college performances, with CCS being my favorite. I cheered them on enthusiastically.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This experience taught me the importance of cheering for others. Life isn’t just about receiving. Sometimes, you have to give your support to others. The event also strengthened the bond among us CCS students. If I could participate in this activity again, I hope my recovery will be complete, so I can join the parade and enjoy the experience fully.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the value of supporting others and being part of a community. It showed me that even if I couldn’t physically participate in the parade, I could still contribute by offering my help and cheering for my fellow students. This sense of camaraderie is something I hope to carry forward in future events.</p>
