                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>Kuwerdas Filipinas, held on September 14, 2024, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM at the Luce Auditorium, was a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the strings of unity as part of the International Rondalla/Plucked String Music Festival. I attended this event as a spectator.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>Initially, I thought the event might be boring since I had never attended a formal musical performance before. However, the moment the musicians started playing, I realized I was wrong. As a guitarist, I connected with the performers and was fascinated by their unconventional use of instruments like tapping for percussion, strumming above the nut for eerie sounds, and near the bridge for a muted tone. Soprano Stefanie Quintin was also outstanding, with extraordinary vocal control and fluency in hitting high and low notes, even in foreign languages.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This experience made me appreciate live performances. Iâ€™ve always preferred staying at home, but this event has made me more open to attending live performances in the future. It also inspired me to explore new techniques on my guitar, and I look forward to trying them out when I return to Siquijor. I only wish the weather had been better, as fewer people were able to attend and witness the beauty of the performance.</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am more eager to explore different styles of music and experiment with my own instrument. It has broadened my musical perspective and motivated me to keep learning and improving my skills, especially after witnessing such a breathtaking performance.</p>
