                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>
                    On September 18, 2024, from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, I participated as a
                    spectator in the Silliman University Campus Tour organized by the
                    College of Computer Studies. The purpose of the event was to
                    familiarize students with the different buildings and the history of
                    the university. It was a great opportunity to explore and learn more
                    about the campus that I have been studying in for the past 1-2
                    months.

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Initially, I thought I knew most about Silliman, but I learned
                        interesting facts about the campus. For example, the orange doors
                        in the College of Business Administration are for emergencies, and
                        some believe a ghost of Alice Fullerton appears every Founder's
                        Day in Alice Fullerton Hall. These details deepen my connection to
                        the place I study.
                    </p>

                <div class="p3">
                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This experience taught me more about Silliman and its history,
                        adding to my knowledge of the university. I believe this will help
                        me navigate the campus better in my day-to-day activities and
                        prevent me from getting lost. The tour made me feel more engaged
                        with the school and has strengthened my sense of attachment to it.

                    <p>
                        Because of this activity, I am more appreciative of the rich
                        history and unique features of Silliman University. I feel more
                        connected to the campus and look forward to learning even more
                        about the place that I now consider a second home. The tour was
                        not just an educational experience, but also a meaningful journey
                        that deepened my connection to Silliman.
