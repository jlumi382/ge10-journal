<h3>What?</h3>
<p>The Movie Night Day 1 event took place on August 20, 2024, at
ATA Hall from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The goal of the event was to
relax and enjoy movies with fellow CCS students. I attended as a
spectator, simply there to hang out and watch a few films.</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>My friend Daniel, a first-year BSIT student, invited me to a
horror movie event, which isn't my favorite genre. I considered
leaving but decided to stay since I paid the Php 20.00 entrance
fee. Luckily, I found my friend David, a fellow BSCS student, and
we had a great time laughing at ourselves during the intense
scenes. However, I didn't sleep well that night in my boarding
house. On the third day, I returned for a much lighter movie,
<q class="green-txt"><b><i>Deadpool & Wolverine</i></b></q>, which
was a fun contrast to <q class="green-txt"><b><i>Gonjiam: Haunted
Asylum</i></b></q>.</p>
</div>
<div class="p3">
<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>This experience reminded me of the importance of taking breaks
and spending time for myself, even in the middle of a busy
schedule. The Movie Night provided a perfect opportunity to unwind
and also brought me closer to my new CCS friends. If I could do
this event again, I’d definitely go back for the second day and not
miss out on the fun.</p>

<h3>How This Changed Me</h3>
<div class="flex-item contents"><img src=

<p>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the importance of
balancing work and relaxation. It’s easy to get caught up in
responsibilities, but taking a few hours to enjoy yourself and bond
with friends can make a big difference in your overall well-being.
This event showed me that unwinding can be a valuable way to stay
connected and refreshed.</p>
