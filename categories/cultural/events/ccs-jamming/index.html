<h3>What?</h3>
<p>On August 21, 2024, I attended the CCS Jamming Sesh Day 3, which
took place at the Computer Center Lobby from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
The event aimed to bring together CCS students to sing, jam, and
have fun during the Hibalag week festivities. As a spectator, I was
there simply to enjoy the music and observe my fellow CCS students
expressing themselves through singing.</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>As the name suggested, the event was a casual and laid-back
jamming session, and it turned out to be just that. I attended on
the third day out of curiosity and met several talented singers,
including Clindon, a fellow CCS Freshman. The atmosphere was
relaxed and enjoyable, reminding me of the importance of taking
breaks and having fun. It was a great reminder that it's okay to
unwind and let go sometimes.</p>

<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>Reflecting on the experience, it strengthened my value of
balance between work and relaxation. I learned that taking time for
fun activities, such as this jamming session, is essential to
maintaining well-being, and I plan to apply this by incorporating
similar breaks into my schedule. The activity is beneficial as it
fosters a sense of community and offers a way for students to
express themselves creatively. If I were to join again, I should
learn how to sing a few songs to increase my involvement.</p>

<h3>How This Changed Me</h3>

<p>Because of this activity, I am reminded of how important it is
to find joy in the little things and to embrace the opportunities
to relax and connect with others. This experience has shown me that
having fun is just as valuable as working hard, and it’s something
I’ll strive to incorporate more into my daily routine.</p>
