<h3>What?</h3>
<p>On September 28, 2024, from 5:30 PM to 10:00 PM, I attended the
CCS Acquaintance Party: Binary Echoes of the Shadows at the
Silliman University Elementary Grounds. Organized by the College of
Computer Studies, the event aimed to help CCS students, also known
as <q class="green-txt"><b><i>Trojans</i></b></q>, meet each other,
build new friendships, and enjoy a night of fun activities. As a
participant and spectator, I joined in the celebrations and
witnessed how the event brought everyone closer together.</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>Initially, I thought the program would be boring for me since
I’m not usually interested in parties. However, I ended up having a
good time thanks to the various games like the <q class=
"green-txt"><b><i>scanf printf</i></b></q> game and the Easter egg
hunt, which provided lots of laughter and enjoyment. Although the
idea of taking breaks isn’t new to me, this event reminded me of
the importance of taking time to relax and have fun, especially
when faced with a busy schedule. It’s easy to forget to rest, but
this experience emphasized how beneficial it is to unwind and enjoy
the moment.</p>

<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>The party allowed me to strengthen my bonds with fellow Trojans
as we shared laughs and memorable moments together. Moving forward,
I plan to continue working closely with my peers as we navigate our
journey here at Silliman University. This was not only a great
opportunity to let loose but also a meaningful way to connect with
others, making it far from a waste of time.</p>

<h3>How This Changed Me</h3>

"Proof">
<p>Because of this activity, I am more encouraged to join future
events and be open to opportunities that bring people together. The
fun and camaraderie I experienced at the acquaintance party showed
me that even though I’m not usually into social events,
participating in them can lead to meaningful connections and
lasting memories. This has inspired me to get more involved and
build even stronger relationships with my fellow Trojans.</p>
