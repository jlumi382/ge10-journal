                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>On August 20, 2024, I participated in the Fitness Challenge Day 1, held at ATA Hall from 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM. The purpose of the event was to enjoy a fun and energetic Zumba session with fellow CCS students. As a participant, I was eager to get involved in what I thought would be a typical workout session.</p>

                    <h3>So What?</h3>
                    <p>At first, I was honestly expecting something more along the lines of strength training, using weights, bodyweight exercises, or even plyometrics which are things I usually enjoy. To my surprise, the event turned out to be a Zumba session. I quickly realized this was even better than what I had expected. Although I'm definitely not the best at dancing, it didn’t matter. I let myself loosen up and simply had fun with it. We worked up a good sweat and shared a lot of laughs, making the experience both enjoyable and rewarding.</p>

                    <h3>Now What?</h3>
                    <p>This experience taught me to be gentler with myself in my recovery from varicocelectomy surgery. Instead of jumping straight into intense workouts or sports, I realized that taking it slow and engaging in fun, low-impact activities like Zumba was exactly what I needed. I attended the first two days of the event and thoroughly enjoyed bonding with my fellow CCS Freshmen. However, if I could go back, I’d make sure to attend the last day as well since I missed it because I overslept!</p>

                    <p>Because of this activity, I am more mindful of listening to my body and allowing myself to recover at a healthier pace. It reminded me that fitness doesn’t always have to be serious or intense. It can be about having fun and connecting with others, all while staying active. This experience has given me a new appreciation for balance in my fitness routine.</p>
