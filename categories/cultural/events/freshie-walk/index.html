<h3>What?</h3>
<p>The Freshie Walk on August 15, 2024, at the Luce Auditorium and
the Amphitheater, was a memorable event designed to welcome us
freshmen to Silliman University. My fellow freshmen from all
Colleges participated, along with the School Pastors, who were the
main speakers, and the confederates who helped in arranging the
event and making it possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section flex-item p2-p3">
<div class="p2">
<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>During the event, I had the opportunity to develop my social
skills and even made a new friend with the person seated next to
me. My expectations for the event was far from what I initially had
in mind. I thought we were just going to march and chant our yells
starting from the Luce Auditorium until we finish one lap around
the school. However, I was pleasantly surprised when we reached the
Amphitheater, where something more significant awaited us. There
were inspiring speeches from our School Pastors, and we were even
given free notebooks, ballpens, and, to my delight, ice cream! The
pastors emphasized the importance of not only trusting in our own
abilities but also putting our faith in God. Their words left a
lasting impression on me, strengthening my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="p3">
<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>This experience taught the importance of faith and friendship. I
will see to it that I and my classmates will continue to strengthen
our bond as we face the challenges of a college student. Without
this activity, I would still have been a lost 18 year old boy with
no social life in Silliman University. If I were to do this event
again as a welcoming upperclassman, I'll make sure to eat all
flavors of ice cream! Jokes aside, I would like to spend a bit more
time on practicing the yell, so that there would be more time for
the freshmen from each college to get to know each other, so that
they will hopefully be less self-conscious, more connected and not
shy to let their voices out when chanting the yell.</p>

<h3>How This Changed Me</h3>
<div class="flex-item contents"><img src=
"../../../../data/events/freshie-walk/proof.jpeg" alt="Proof">
<p>Because of this activity, I am more faithful to God and I’ve
made my first friends at Silliman University. Friendships I hope
will last a lifetime.</p>
